# Social Learning vs. Individual Learning

Division of labor, or the specialization of tasks among different individuals within a population is a fundamental mechanism in the study of social organizations such as social insect colonies. It allows for efficient resource use and improves the chances of survival for the entire population. We explore two commonly used behavioural update rules, _individual learning_ and _social learning_, as two different methods of information processing by individuals. We employ Adaptive dynamics as an Evolutionary Game Theory framework and Cross-learning as a form of Reinforcement learning to compare the dynamics of the population in various environmental settings under the social and individual learning assumptions respectively.
